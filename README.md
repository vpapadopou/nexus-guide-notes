# Nexus Guide Notes

A collection of notes on the Nexus Guide. Organized in bullet point format, these can help you better understand the key concepts of Nexus and highlight important points. I also found them extremely useful while preparing for the Scaled Professional Scrum certification. It is highly recommended, however, that you read the Nexus Guide first to obtain a complete understanding of the Nexus framework.

Note: The only reliable source of information for Nexus is the official Nexus Guide. You should always double check everything you read here with the official Nexus guide as changes might have been made or I might have not understood something completely. 

Based on the January 2018 version of the [Nexus Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/online-nexus-guide)
